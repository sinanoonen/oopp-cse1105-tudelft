## Current Tempo
Satisfactory, we could try to pick up the pace now that the midterms are over.

## Extensions
What optional features do we want to implement? Statistics.
Statistics can be implemented if we get frontend done by the end of the week.
Should be quite simple, as we have already done the groundwork.

Emails will be probably be too much, we want to focus on getting our current product as polished as possible.

## Assignments and Improvement
Frontend and backend developers switch, fix the other's work and polish everything up.

Dedicate some time to fixing the code of conduct. (Should not be our biggest worry)

## Work For This Week
- Get most of the frontend done. We still have other things, so it would be good to have that done.
  - Manage Participants
  - add participants to an event.
  - Link together all the pages.
  - Bugfix, cannot start server.
  - Accessibility.
  
Stefan will continue work on the adminPage, Emilio will try to fix the server issues. Other tasks can be divided in the whatsapp group.
