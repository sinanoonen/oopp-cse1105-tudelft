# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Good.
Your agenda includes good talking points and time estimations that add up to the duration of the meeting. I would suggest to add time estimation and some details to the subtopics of each talking point. For example, what do you want to discuss about "User flow"? And for how long? When will you switch to the color scheme? Also include a section for the demo.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Sufficient.
It is a bit difficult to assess this, as the week 3 meeting itself did not include many agreements and constructive discussions. You mention some points that were discussed, but way too briefly. Ideally, the minutes should contain any concrete agreements (decisions, task assignments) you reached during the meeting.

#### Chair performance
Very good.
You followed the topics of the agenda and ensured that you spent roughly the estimated time for each talking point. However, you didn't ask for your teammates' opinions when you saw that they don't intend to share anything. It is good to make sure that everyone says what they might have on their minds even if they find it not that important (in other words, that you guide the discussion). Either way, good job!

#### Attitude & Relation
Very good.
You listened to each other's opinions, and all of you contributed to the discussion. The atmosphere was constructive, and you had relevant, focused discussions. However, sometimes, when one of you wanted to say something but the discussion kept on going, you didn't stop to ask that person what they wanted to say. You can improve on that. Either way, good job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Sufficient.
You seem to be on track to finish your project. However, given that I didn't see a demo last week, it is difficult to say if there was enough progress. Furthermore, for safety, I would suggest to pick up the pace a bit. Also, I recommend to do frontend and backend in parallel, so that you have new fully-functioning features every week. Also also, please include it in the agenda, preferably at the beginning :)

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Good.
It seems like all of you contribute to the project. However, try not to separate tests from features. Ideally, when someone implements a feature, they should also test it.
