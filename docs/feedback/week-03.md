# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Good.
It has good topics, it roughly follows the format, and it is nice that you added subtopics for each topic - it makes preparation for the meeting easier. However, in terms of time management, you should first try to add time estimates for each subtopic, and, secondly, the time estimates should add up to ~45 minutes. Note that the time estimates for the subtopics of the conclusion don't add up to the time estimate of the conclusion, and that the Code of Conduct section doesn't have anything to it. Also, for example, should you first discuss tasks or milestones? In my opinion, it would make more sense to first discuss what you plan to do the next weeks, and then to divide the tasks according to the plan.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Very good.
It is nice that you added all the agreements and conclusions to your discussions in a clear, concrete format. However, ideally, you should include some more notes about what has been discussed, not only about the conclusions you reached. The notes should follow the flow of the discussion (don't get me wrong, you shouldn't write too much either).

#### Chair performance
Insufficient. 
This point covers the actual organization of the meeting. You didn't ensure that each talking point is properly covered. You followed the points of the agenda, but every talking point was only briefly touched upon. You should try to roughly respect the time estimates of the agenda - this point goes hand in hand with having a good agenda. If you feel like you allocated too much time for a topic, it means that the agenda was not thought of extremely well. Going back to the fact that each talking point was only briefly touched upon, a chairman has the responsibility to ensure that the discussion surrounding each talking point is constructive. This means that you shouldn't only bring a topic up just to quickly go through every topic on the agenda and finish the meeting. Instead, you should guide the discussion so that it has a purpose and conclusions. For each talking point you should have an actual, useful, constructive discussion that you should have either way, with or without these supervised meetings. Also, each topic should have some sort of conclusion - the agreements you reached or some future actions that you want to take. 

#### Attitude & Relation
Good.
This has improved since last week - I am happy to see that you contribute more equally to the discussion and that you are more inclined to say your opinions. You should definitely try to keep this up. However, after the agenda-guided part of the meeting was over, you didn't really try to set it back on track. In case you feel like something is going wrong, don't be afraid to bring it up and to try to solve it.

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Insufficient.
You didn't show me the current state of your application. You should try to have something to show me every week - this implies that you should not leave all frontend implementation for the later weeks. Also, as you didn't show me your progress, I cannot say that you are on track.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Insufficient.
There wasn't a discussion about what each one of you did last week, and if you managed to complete your tasks. It would be great to include a small section during the meeting in which you take short turns (~20-30 seconds) explaining what you did the previous sprint. Also, make sure that your tasks are as equally distributed (in terms of both topics and weights) as possible. You can work only on one topic in a week, but by the end of the project you should be familiar with all the technologies presented in the course.
