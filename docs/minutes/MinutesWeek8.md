## Current Tempo
Satisfactory, vacation slowed a bit the work down but we are on track

## BackLog Discussion and Extensions
Let's create new issues and add estimated time and as much detail as possible
We miss use-flow in project pitch but slides are not that bad. Should check if we contain all points in project pitch assignment
We should practice it and check how much time it takes we probably want to be talking over the videos
Pipeline is gonna be slow close to code freeze so better finish early.
