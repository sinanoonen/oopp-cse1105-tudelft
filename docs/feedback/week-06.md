# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Sufficient.
The agenda contains relevant topics, but it is not very clear. You do not have timestamps for the subpoints of each larger point. Also, you should ask yourselves if the timestamps are realistic - did you spend only 3 minutes discussing the assignments feedback for all the topics?

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Good.
Your notes followed the agenda, but they are not extremely clear. For example, “Add event window” means that it is a feature that you plan to do? Until when? Or did you already do it? Try to be clearer in your notes.

#### Chair performance
Sufficient.
It is great that you guided the discussion and that you asked for people’s opinions and approvals. However, you didn’t really cover the topics of the agenda for the estimated amounts of time. You should ensure that all the topics are covered for the appropriate amount of time (this also includes good estimates on the agenda).

#### Attitude & Relation
Very good.
The atmosphere was generally constructive. Everyone contributed to the discussion at least a bit and people’s opinions were taken into account. However, when you see that the meeting duration doesn’t correspond to the estimated one, you should say something!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Good.
You have a nice UI and nice features. It seems like you are on track to finish your project by the end of the course.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Sufficient.
It seems like everyone is involved in the project, which is nice. However, keep in mind that tests are not a whole separate task, and that, ideally, each MR should come together with its own tests.
