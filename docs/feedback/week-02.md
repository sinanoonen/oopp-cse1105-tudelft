# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Excellent.
Your agenda looks good, and the way you organized it makes sense. It is great that you added some subquestions to each talking point. For future meetings, when you will have more complex things to discuss, you should continue to break them down in smaller bullet points.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
N/A

#### Chair performance
Insufficient.
You didn't really guide the meeting, and you didn't ensure that all the topics in the agenda are covered for the proposed time. When you are the chairman, your task is to make sure that the discussion is productive and follows the agenda.

#### Attitude & Relation
Insufficient.
Not everyone was active in the meeting. Half of you were contributing to the discussion, while the others didn't contribute that much. This should be improved on both sides: the first half of you should try to include the others in the conversation (ask them for their opinion etc.), and the second half should try to actively contribute to the discussion on your own. Please make sure that everyone is actually involved in the meeting. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product
N/A

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Good. 
There was not a lot to do for the project this week, so I cannot say a lot about this. However, by observing your discussion, it feels like not all of you contribute equally to the project. Don't sit back and wait for the others to tell you what to do, but also don't try to do the whole project with only some of your teammates - both can have a negative impact on your team.
