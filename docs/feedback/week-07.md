# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Good.
The agenda looks relatively good and the topics make sense. It would be nice to add time estimates for the subpoints of each point, too.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Very good.
The notes are mostly clear and contain concrete ideas and agreements. There are some things that are not perfectly clear - what do you mean with all the things that need to be done?

#### Chair performance
Very good.
You covered all the topics of the agenda for roughly the appropriate amount of time. You guided the discussion well and listened to your teammatesâ€™ opinions. Good job!

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
The atmosphere was constructive and everyone contributed to the discussion. It was nice that all of you shared your opinions and contributed to the goal of the meeting. Good job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Very good.
You made some great improvements since last week. You should be on track to finish at least the basic requirements by the end of the course.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Very good.
It seems like all of you contributed to the project. As before, I cannot clearly assess this just from the conversation.
