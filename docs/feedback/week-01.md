#### 1) Self-organization
Sufficient
The team switched often from subject to subject. There were frequent attempts at organization from some students but they did not really 'stick'. To improve try to regularly check your agenda and see which points you have already covered, how much time you have left and what you still have to do. (by agenda I mean the points of conversation in the slides). Also try to keep an eye on students who are speaking less, and involve them by directly asking them questions or asking for their opinion. 


#### 2) Suggested Topics
Good.
All subjects were discussed, after some steering from the TA. Try to keep an eye on the topics you have to discuss and come prepared by preparing and reading the agenda.
