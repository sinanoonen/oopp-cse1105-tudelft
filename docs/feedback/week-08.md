# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Sufficient.
The subpoints of each point do not contain time estimates. Also, the estimate for the extension discussion doesn’t seem realistic - even during the meeting, you spent more time on this.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Very good.
The notes follow the discussion, are clear and contain agreements you reached. You should have also added some sort of conclusion to the “work for this week section” - at least say that you are going to divide the tasks in a subsequent meeting.

#### Chair performance
Good.
You guided the discussion well. Even though you didn’t fully follow the agenda, it’s not that bad in this case, as you had to also account for the given feedback. When you saw that some of your teammates didn’t talk as much, you could’ve asked for their input more.

#### Attitude & Relation
Very good.
It is nice that all of you contributed to the discussion at least a bit. The atmosphere was friendly and constructive. However, it would’ve been nice if all of you were roughly equally involved in the discussion. 

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Very good.
You had some nice additions since last week’s version, good job! You should be able to finish at least the basic requirements on time.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Very good.
From what I’ve heard, it seems like all of you are contributing to the project. Take this with a grain of salt though, as I only base my assessment on what was said during the meeting.
